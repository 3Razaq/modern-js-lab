Modern JavaScript Syntax Lab Outline

## Introduction

Brief Overview: In the past decade, roughly, JavaScript has undergone a massive transformation in its syntax.  This has largely been due to accommodate developer requests to make the syntax easier to use.  Many of the new features that have come out have been incorporated as standard practices in frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular, and many others.  The important thing to note here is that most these changes do not provide any additional functionality.  Rather, they provide a more efficient way to write code using the language.

## Learning Goals:

In this lab, you'll explore modern JavaScript syntax and compare it to more traditional syntax.  

While the modern syntax has many benefits, a strong understanding of the traditional way of writing JavaScript provides a crucial foundation not just for JS, but for other languages as well.  Not all languages have these kinds of shortcuts.  As a developer, you'll be required to learn other languages that have their own nuances but that are built upon the same foundations as JavaScript.  It's important that the modern syntax covered in this lesson not become a crutch, so that when required to use a different language, you don't have to learn everything from scratch

## Lab Structure

In this lab, we will provide a brief explanation of each topic, an example of the topic, as well as the traditional way of accomplishing the same task so that you can see how it relates to basic programming as a whole.

## Topics and Exercises

### `.map` Method
Explanation: Introduce the .map method, explaining its use in transforming arrays.
Exercise: Provide an array of numbers and ask students to use .map to create a new array with each number changed

### Destructuring
Explanation: Describe object and array destructuring for extracting values.
Exercise: Give an object or array and ask students to extract specific values using destructuring.

### Spread Operator
Explanation: Explain the spread operator and its use in expanding arrays or objects.
Exercise: Challenge students to combine multiple arrays or clone an object using the spread operator.

### Dynamic Keys in Objects
Explanation: Discuss how to use variables as object keys.
Exercise: Ask students to create an object using dynamic keys based on given variables.

### Import and Export
Explanation: Explain ES6 modules and the import/export syntax.
Exercise: Simulate a small project structure where students have to import and export functions or objects across files.

### Default Parameters
Explanation: Introduce default parameters in functions.
Exercise: Instruct students to write functions that use default parameters to handle missing arguments.

### Ternary Operator
Explanation: Introduce the ternary operator as a concise if-else syntax.
Exercise: Provide a scenario for students to implement a simple decision-making process using the ternary operator.

### And/Boolean Gates
Explanation: Cover the use of logical operators for boolean logic and control flow.
Exercise: Create a scenario where students use logical AND or OR to make decisions in code.

### Optional Chaining
Explanation: Describe optional chaining for safely accessing nested object properties.
Exercise: Provide a nested object and have students access deep properties using optional chaining.
